EntitasKit is a member of Entitas family. Entitas is a framework, which helps developers follow [Entity Component System architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entityâ€“componentâ€“system) (or ECS for short). Even though ECS finds it roots in game development. Entitas proved to be helpfull for App development. 

It can be used as: 
- [service registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern)
- strategy for [event driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
- highly flexible data model, based on generic [product type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_type)

Applications designed with ECS, are proved to be easy to unit test and simple to change.

## How does it work

Let's imagine we have an app which has a NetworkingService. This networking service is implemented as a class or a struct, we really don't care ðŸ˜‰. We need to be able to use this networking service from multiple places in our app. This is a typical use case for service locator pattern.

### How can we make it work with EntitasKit?
First we need to import EntitasKit and create a context.
```
import EntitasKit

let appContext = Context()
```
Now we need to define a _component_ which will hold reference to our networking service:
```
struct NetworkingServiceComponent: UniqueComponent {
    let ref: NetworkingService
}
```

The component is defined as _unique component_, this means that a context can hold only one instance of such component. And as a matter of fact, we would like to have only one networking service present in our application.
Now lets setup our context.

```
func setupAppContext() {
    appContext.setUniqueComponent(NetworkingServiceComponent(ref: NetworkingService()))
}
```

In the setup function, we instatiate networking service component with an instance of networking service and put the component into our app context.

Now, if we want to call `sendMessage` method on our networking service, we can do it as following:

```
appContext.uniqueComponent(NetworkingServiceComponent.self)?.ref.sendMessage()
```

I mentioned before that EntitasKit makes it easy to test your app. This is due to the fact, that even though the networking service is unique in your app it can be easily replaced/mocked in your test. Just call this in your test setup method.

```
appContext.setUniqueComponent(NetworkingServiceComponent(ref: NetworkingServiceMock()))
```

And call `setupAppContext()` during tear down.

---

Let me show you another typical problem which can be solved with service registry and EntitasKit.

Imagine you have an app and there is an unfortunate feature requirement. You need to show a modal view controller on top of another modal view controller. And than, there needs to be a way, not only to discard the current modal view controller, but all modal view controllers.

For this use case we will create another _component_:

```
struct ModalViewControllerComponent: Component {
    weak var ref: UIViewController?
}
```

This time our _component_ is not unique and the field of the component is a _weak_ reference to `UIViewController`. The refernce should be weak because we don't want to retain a view controller in our context. It should be retained only through our view controller hierarchy.

In the `viewDidLoad` method of the modal view controller, we can register our view by adding follwoing line:

```
appContext.createEntity().set(ModalViewControllerComponent(ref: self))
```

As you can see, this time we create an entity and set modal view controller component on it, referencing `self`. Entity is a very generic product type, which can hold any instance which implements `Component` or `UniqueComponent` protocol. The only caveat is that it cannot hold multiple instances of the same type.

Let's assume, we have a situation where we showed multiple modal view controller and want to dismiss them all. How can we do it?

```
for entity in appContext.group(ModalViewControllerComponent.matcher) {
    entity.get(ModalViewControllerComponent.self)?.ref?.dismiss(animated: false, completion: nil)
    entity.destroy()
}
```

In the code above, we see that we can ask context for group of entites which have `ModalViewControllerComponent`. `Group` implements `Sequence` protocol, this is why we can iterate through entities in it. Acceess the modal view controller component and call `dismiss` methd on it's reference. We than destroy the entity, because we don't need to hold the reference to the modal view controller any more.

---

## Strategy for event driven programming

An event in Entitas is also just a component

```
let eventContext = Context()

struct MyEventComponent: Component {}
```

As you can see, we defined a context for events and a component `MyEvent`. The component does not have properties in this case, but it is ok to have an event which transports data. It is just not needed in our example.

Now we need to describe the observer

```
protocol EventObserver: class {
    func eventDidOccur()
}

struct EventObserverComponent: Component {
    weak var ref: EventObserver?
}
```

We defined a protocol which classes has to implement in order to become an event observer. I decided to restrain the implementors to classes because, mostly the event observers are UIKit classes and this way, we can define the reference in the `EventObserverComponent` as `weak`. However if you wan to decouple event observing from UIKit, you can rethink this restriction.

The component we defined are very similar to what we did in the service registry part. However now we will introduce something new.

```
class MyEventNotifyObserverSystem: ReactiveSystem {
    let collector: Collector = Collector(group: eventContext.group(MyEventComponent.matcher), type: .added)
    let name = "Notify event observer"
    let observers = eventContext.group(EventObserverComponent.matcher)
    
    func execute(entities: Set<Entity>) {
        for observer in observers {
            observer.get(EventObserverComponent.self)?.ref?.eventDidOccur()
        }
    }
}
```

We introudced a reactive system. A reactive system is something like a reducer, if you are familira with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#reducer) or [ReSwift](http://reswift.github.io/ReSwift/master/getting-started-guide.html). However, reactive systems are triggered by state change not an explicit action.

When we implement a `ReactiveSystem` protocol we need to provide two properties:
- name, this is just a string used for logging
- collector, an instance of a class which will monitor a group and collect entites on a defined collection change type

In our example we define, that we want to collect from a group of `MyEventComponent` entities. And we would like to collect them when they enter the group. Meaning that when we create a new entity and set `MyEventComponent` for the first time, this entity gets collected.

So if we have something like this in a view cotnroller:

```
    @IBAction func buttonPushed(sender: Any) {
        eventContext.createEntity().set(MyEventComponent())
    }
```

Our button pushed "event" will be processed by `MyEventNotifyObserverSystem`.

To defien the "processing" logic we have to implement the `execute(entities:)` method. As we can see in the listing above, to make it all work, we just walk through observers and call `eventDidOccur`.

If a view controller would register itself as observer

```
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        eventContext.createEntity().set(EventObserverComponent(ref: self))
        ...
    }
```

We will get something people call unidirectional data flow.

A reactive system by itself is not doing anything, it is just a definition of behaviour. In order for it to run, we have to put it in a reactive loop

```
let eventLoop = ReactiveLoop(ctx: eventContext, systems: [MyEventNotifyObserverSystem()])
```

Now if we push the button, event loop will trigger the reactive system, which will call all registered observers.

---

As you can see the `buttonPushed` `IBAction` is creating new entites every time. This means that we are polluting memory with all this previous events. Now don't get me wrong, specifically if the event would carry some data, it might be a desirable effect, but in our case we would like to clean up previous events. For this we can implement another reactive system

```
class MyEventCleanupSystem: ReactiveSystem {
    let collector: Collector = Collector(group: eventContext.group(MyEventComponent.matcher), type: .added)
    let name = "Event cleanup system"
    
    func execute(entities: Set<Entity>) {
        for e in entities {
            e.destroy()
        }
    }
}
```

and add it to the event loop

```
let eventLoop = ReactiveLoop(ctx: eventContext, systems: [MyEventNotifyObserverSystem(), MyEventCleanupSystem()])
```

As the execution order of systems is granted by `systems` array, we can be certain that a new event will be first processed by `MyEventNotifyObserverSystem` and than destroyed by `MyEventCleanupSystem`.

You might think, wouldn't it be easier to destroy the event entity directly in `MyEventNotifyObserverSystem` and skip definition of cleanup system? This might be true for a simple examples, but in complex applications it is better to stick to [single responsibility principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and therefor split up the notification and cleanup logic in to separate systems.

---

In previous section I mentioned that execution order of the systems is granted. Is the ecexuction order of the observers granted as well?

In current implementation it is not and there are two reasons for it:
1. `Group` is backed by a `Set`, this means that when we iterate other a group we can't predict the order.
2. It is also hard to predict the order, when the observers will register. This call `eventContext.createEntity().set(EventObserverComponent(ref: self))` will be executed in different scenarios and decoupled from each other.

But no worries if the execution order is important in your use case it is a simple problem to fix.

We can introduce another component

```
struct ExecutionIndexComponent: Component {
    let value: Int
}
```

And let listeners/observers define there execution order

```
class Listener: EventObserver {
    let index: Int
    init(_ index: Int) {
        self.index = index
        eventContext.createEntity().set(EventObserverComponent(ref: self)).set(ExecutionIndexComponent(value: index))
    }
    func eventDidOccur() {
        print("!!!!! \(index)")
    }
}

let listeners = (1...10).map{Listener($0)}
```

Now we can write a new reactive system which will execute the observers in defined order.

```
class MyEventNotifyObserverInOrderSystem: ReactiveSystem {
    let collector: Collector = Collector(group: eventContext.group(MyEventComponent.matcher), type: .added)
    let name = "Notify event observer"
    let observers = eventContext.group(Matcher(all: [EventObserverComponent.cid,  ExecutionIndexComponent.cid]))
    
    func execute(entities: Set<Entity>) {
        let sortedObservers = observers.sorted(forObject: ObjectIdentifier(self)) { (e1, e2) -> Bool in
            return (e1.get( ExecutionIndexComponent.self)?.value ?? Int.max) < (e2.get( ExecutionIndexComponent.self)?.value ?? Int.max)
        }
        for observer in sortedObservers {
            observer.get(EventObserverComponent.self)?.ref?.eventDidOccur()
        }
    }
}
```

I want to point out two details in `MyEventNotifyObserverInOrderSystem`:

1. The `observers` field is now a more complex group. We say that it is a group of entites which have `EventObserverComponent` and `ExecutionIndex` components
2. We compute `sortedObservers` in the `execute` method. It recompute the sorted observers each time because than it is always up to date. This way we support removing and addign observers at runtime. Also as you can see we are using a special `sorted` method. It caches the result of the sorting, if group did not change.

Now as we have a reactive system which is responsible for notifying observers with execution order, let's change our `MyEventNotifyObserverSystem` to not handle observers with execution order. This can be done by exchanging the `observers` property definition

```
let observers = eventContext.group(Matcher(all: [EventObserverComponent.cid], none: [ExecutionIndexComponent.cid]))
```

Here we say that we need a group of entities which have `EventObserverComponent` but don't have `ExecutionIndexComponent`

Last, but not least. Lets update our event loop

```
let eventLoop = ReactiveLoop(ctx: eventContext, systems: [MyEventNotifyObserverSystem(), MyEventNotifyObserverInOrderSystem(), MyEventCleanupSystem()])
```

And we are done.
